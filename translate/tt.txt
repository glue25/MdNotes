Careful readers may
wonder the feasibility of conducting a static łcross comparisonž,
by decompiling the same executable with a set of decompilers and
identifying differences in their outputs. However, we note that
decompiled C code can have drastically different representations
since different decompilers implement their own tactics and trans￾lation templates (although they share identical semantics). Here,
we compile 500 programs randomly generated by Csmith into exe￾cutable files. For each executable file, we use four decompilers to
decompile it and cross compare the similarity (also with moss [6])
of four decompiled C code. We report the average similarity score
as follows:
IDA-Pro JEB3 RetDec Radare2/Ghidra
The average cross similarity score is indeed low (on average 0.68),
which sheds light on practical needs to advocate more consistent
representations and regulations. Overall, we leave it as one future
work to explore practical methods to perform cross comparison,
for instance by extracting certain łsemantics-levelž invariants.
